## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

JACKSON POWELL WEBSITE

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

Creating a unique personal website.
This would serve as both a public website for anyone to access as well a secret database for unreleased content given to those with privileged access.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There will be 2 main areas of the website. The public are will have a home page with options to stream music, buy merch, view tour dates,
post/comment/read a forum (instead of a contact option, people can post on the forum and either see their question there or have it answered by other people rather than me first),
read a bio, donate, or visit social media. I envision this will be a very minimalist site with a simple and obvious layout.
The second area of the site will require that the person answer 2 questions in order to gain access.
"What is your name?" "permission: PIN "
The PIN is 36251. Anyone who would guess that deserves access, but i'll change the questions periodically.
This will then give you access to an abstracted version of the site where you will see unreleased album covers with titles blurred and access restricted. When you click on the album covers they will ask for a password: those who I know will have the password.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

THE HOME PAGE: So a banner and at least 3 redirects or pop ups .
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A home Page and a demo for the secret database

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A finished website ready to publish.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will need to plan out how to approach this. I need to begin with a name and then a program, then an order and a timeframe for each task.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

The GITHUB, ChatGPT, reddit / discord.
